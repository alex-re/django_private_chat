# Django Private Chat

#### A simple django private chat built with django channels.

##### Don't forget start redis server `sudo service redis-server start`!
###### And set this environment variable `export DJANGO_ALLOW_ASYNC_UNSAFE=True` until I find a better way. 
###### (Suggested ways for async consumers are welcomed ðŸ˜‰)

###### (TODOs will be in the body of my code ðŸ˜‰ too)

- - [x] async chat
- - [ ] add react
- - [ ] more clean codes ðŸ˜Ž
